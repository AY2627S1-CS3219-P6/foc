# Verification email: Mailpit locally, SES on AWS

User Service retains its existing `OtpSender` boundary. SMTP/Mailpit is the
default. Selecting SES uses its HTTPS API with the AWS SDK's normal credential
chain. It does not use the sender mailbox's password, SMTP credentials, Supabase
Auth, a new service or a new database schema. Registration/verification/resend
endpoints and security rules remain unchanged.

## Configuration and development compatibility

| Setting | Development | SES deployment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OTP_EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `smtp` (default) | `ses`, explicitly selected |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_FROM` | Existing Mailpit settings | Not used by the SES sender |
| `SES_REGION` | Optional/blank | The region where sender and sending access are configured |
| `SES_FROM_ADDRESS` | Optional/blank | Exact verified sender mailbox |
| AWS credentials | Not needed | Temporary EC2 instance-role credentials |

Root and User-service development Compose explicitly select SMTP and point to
Mailpit. Normal local development does not create an AWS session or send real
email. Existing test-injected senders remain supported. The cloud Compose also
defaults to SMTP for backward compatibility; updating the image alone does not
switch an existing cloud environment to SES. Do not copy cloud configuration
over development settings or regenerate existing keys/passwords.

SES settings are validated before startup when selected. The client is created
lazily in a delivery thread, so network/credential discovery does not block the
async event loop or occur during default SMTP startup. Each delivery uses a
short-lived SDK client with connect/read timeouts and one SDK attempt: SendEmail
has no idempotency token, so the existing explicit resend flow handles uncertain
delivery. A timeout may mean the provider accepted the first email; a resend
replaces the valid OTP under the existing rules.

Provider rejection, quota/throttling, missing credentials and connectivity errors
become the existing `503 OTP_DELIVERY_FAILED` response. There is no fallback to
Mailpit or fake successful registration when SES fails. The already committed
pending challenge remains subject to the current resend/expiry rules; the user
is not activated and registration events are not emitted until verification.

Only safe failure metadata is logged. SDK debug logging is suppressed to avoid
logging request bodies/authorization headers. SES message acceptance is not a
guarantee of inbox delivery: test the actual intended recipient and inspect
provider feedback. A sender using a third-party mailbox domain cannot configure
that domain's DKIM; a verified domain controlled by the team is a stronger
deliverability setup if mailbox-only sending is rejected or classified as spam.

## AWS setup (operator steps; not performed by the application)

1. Check `sesv2 get-account` in Singapore. Sandbox/identity state is regional.
   The initial course account check reported sending enabled, sandbox enabled,
   200 messages/day, one/second. Check current settings rather than assuming
   those values remain unchanged.
2. Create an SES email identity for a real personal/group mailbox the team may
   use and can open. Click the verification email's link in that mailbox. This
   establishes sender control, not ownership of its whole domain. Never provide
   the mailbox password to the application or AWS CLI command.
3. While in the sandbox, verify each intended **test recipient** too. The
   application still accepts registration only for `@u.nus.edu`; its normal OTP
   email and the one-time AWS verification email are different messages.
   Production access is needed before arbitrary NUS students can register
   without first being verified with AWS.
4. Add a scoped inline send policy to the EC2 instance role (`foc-ec2-role`),
   replacing both placeholders in
   [`ses-send-email.policy.example.json`](../../deploy/aws/iam/ses-send-email.policy.example.json)
   with the account ID and exact verified sender identity. Attach only the SES
   send action/identity, not administrator or full SES permissions. Keep the
   existing SSM policy. The operator's SSO role and EC2 application role are
   distinct; being able to inspect SES on the PC does not grant EC2 send access.
5. Check that the User container can use IMDSv2 instance-role credentials. The
   existing EC2 metadata response hop limit must support the container network
   (commonly two); do not disable IMDSv2 or paste credentials into Compose.
   Instance-role permissions are host-level, not a per-container role boundary;
   keep them narrow. Use application delivery/error checks without printing
   credential endpoint responses.
6. Merge the tested User Service change and pull it on EC2. Use the cloud
   configuration helper below to enable SES, rebuild/recreate User API and
   verify actual NUS inbox delivery. Keep the private Mailpit container for
   controlled development/demo use; do not expose its inbox publicly.
7. For independent public signup, request SES production access for transactional
   OTP mail, with an accurate description of consent, rate limits and how the
   team handles bounce/complaint feedback. Approval is separate from sender
   verification and is not guaranteed. Do not claim access has been granted
   before checking `ProductionAccessEnabled` again.

No AWS resource is created, sender verified, policy attached, real email sent or
production request submitted by the service code or CI tests.

## Enable on EC2 once sender/recipient/IAM are ready

After a reviewed merge, from `/opt/foc` as `ssm-user`, replace the example with
the exact verified mailbox (no display name):

```bash
python3 deploy/aws/scripts/configure_email.py --provider ses --region ap-southeast-1 --sender sender@example.com
```

This atomically changes only the provider/region/sender fields in the existing
ignored cloud environment, retaining owner-only mode and all other credentials,
keys and data. It does not change AWS settings or send an email.

```bash
python3 deploy/aws/scripts/validate.py --public
```

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file deploy/aws/.env -f deploy/aws/compose.yaml -f deploy/aws/compose.public.yaml --profile chat --profile admin --profile voice-assist build user-service
```

```bash
sudo docker compose --env-file deploy/aws/.env -f deploy/aws/compose.yaml -f deploy/aws/compose.public.yaml --profile chat --profile admin --profile voice-assist up -d --no-deps user-service
```

User API recreation briefly interrupts User-dependent requests. No database
reset, admin bootstrap, key rotation or restart of unrelated services is needed.
The outbox publisher does not send OTP email, so it needs no email-only restart.

For an intentional return to the private test inbox, select `--provider smtp`
with the helper and recreate the API. That is an operator mode change, not an
automatic fallback after a failed SES request.

## Acceptance checks

- With default development Compose, register and read the OTP in Mailpit; no AWS
  role, verified sender or external email is needed.
- With SES and a verified sandbox test recipient, register through the public
  HTTPS URL and receive the OTP in the actual NUS inbox (check spam as well).
- An invalid code does not activate the account; resend invalidates the old code;
  the new valid code activates once and writes the normal registration event.
- When SES rejects/throttles the request or credentials are unavailable, the API
  reports `OTP_DELIVERY_FAILED`; no silent test-inbox send or activated user.
- Check the normal Credit registration allocation still follows successful user
  verification. This change does not modify that asynchronous workflow.
- No OTP, recipient, provider exception body or credentials appear in ordinary
  failure logs/API errors. Existing configuration secrets are not rotated.

Automated SES tests use botocore Stubber with dummy credentials, never real AWS.
Real PostgreSQL integration tests exercise failed delivery/resend/activation;
live Mailpit checks use a disposable inbox. Inbox delivery, IMDS credentials and
SES production approval remain operator/live acceptance steps.
