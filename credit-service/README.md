# FoC Credit Service

Credit owns FoC's closed credit economy: one wallet per user, the initial allocation,
atomic reserve/release/transfer for errands, and an append-only transaction ledger.

## Stack and boundaries

Python 3.13, FastAPI/Pydantic, SQLAlchemy async/asyncpg and a separate Supabase
PostgreSQL 17 project, following Order Service's runtime conventions. Credit never
reads another service's database and is never read by one; other services reach it
only through its versioned HTTP API and `foc.events` messages.

The application factory owns a connection pool and closes it on shutdown. Startup
does not connect, migrate or seed the database. Readiness runs a bounded read-only
check that the `credit_service` schema is reachable; liveness is independent of it.

## Local setup

Run from `credit-service/`. Docker Desktop must already be running.

1. Create an isolated Python 3.13 environment and install dependencies.

   Windows Git Bash:

   ```bash
   py -3.13 -m venv .venv
   .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
   ```

   On macOS/Linux use `python3.13` and `.venv/bin/python`. PowerShell can use
   `py -3.13` and `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

2. Install the team-pinned Supabase CLI and start **this service's** database:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npx supabase start
   ```

   The project ID is `credit-service`. Auth, Data API, storage, realtime, analytics,
   SMTP and edge functions are disabled. Studio is an operator UI, never a browser
   dependency of FoC.

3. Copy `.env.example` to an ignored `.env` only if `.env` does not already exist.
   Set `DATABASE_URL` to the connection URL from this project's `npx supabase status`.
   Host applications use `127.0.0.1:16522`. Do not reuse a User, Supplier or Order URL.

   The migration creates a `credit_service_app` NOLOGIN role with schema USAGE and
   table-specific grants. A deployment operator provisions a dedicated login that
   inherits this role; no login/password is embedded in migrations.

4. Start the API:

   ```bash
   .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8003
   ```

| Purpose | Address |
| --- | --- |
| Credit API / Swagger | `http://localhost:8003/docs` |
| Process liveness | `http://localhost:8003/health/live` |
| Database readiness | `http://localhost:8003/health/ready` |
| Credit Studio | `http://localhost:16523` (select `credit_service`) |
| Credit PostgreSQL | `127.0.0.1:16522` (not a webpage) |

Reserved local ports are in `1652x`, separate from User's `1542x`, Supplier's `5532x`
and Order's `1642x`.

## Migrations and preserved data

`supabase/migrations/` is the sole schema history. Never use SQLAlchemy `create_all`,
an additional migration framework or startup DDL.

```bash
npx supabase migration new <description>
npx supabase migration up --local
```

Reconstruct migrations with `npx supabase db reset --local` **only in an explicitly
disposable Credit database**. The reset deletes local application data. Ordinary
`npx supabase stop` / `npx supabase start` retains it.

## Tests

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q -m "not integration"
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check app tests
```

Integration tests **write and truncate data**. Set `CREDIT_TEST_DATABASE_URL` in your
terminal to your own disposable, migrated Credit database (for example the local
administrative URL from `npx supabase status`). The broker tests also need
`CREDIT_TEST_RABBITMQ_URL`; they use a throwaway exchange and queues, never `foc.events`.

```bash
export CREDIT_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:16522/postgres'
export CREDIT_TEST_RABBITMQ_URL='amqp://<user>:<password>@127.0.0.1:5672/'
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q -m integration
```

CI runs lint, the unit/ASGI tests and an image build. Tests marked `integration` are
explicitly deselected there, not counted as passing.

## Event consumer

`credit-consumer` is a separate process from the same image. It binds
`credit-service.events` to `foc.events` for `user.registered.v1` and the four
`order.*.v1` terminal events, plus a `.retry` queue (TTL, dead-letters back) and a
`.dlq` queue. It refuses to start without `INITIAL_CREDIT_ALLOCATION` or `RABBITMQ_URL`.

```bash
.venv/Scripts/credit-consumer
```

Changing `CONSUMER_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS` changes the retry queue's arguments: delete
`credit-service.events.retry` in the RabbitMQ UI before restarting, or RabbitMQ rejects
the redeclaration. Contracts, states and retry rules are in [API.md](API.md).

## Running with the whole stack

From the repository root, after User's setup (its `.env`) and with Credit's database
running:

1. Copy `credit-service/.env.docker.example` to `credit-service/.env.docker` and fill in
   `DATABASE_URL` (host `host.docker.internal:16522`) and a random `ORDER_SERVICE_SECRET`.
2. Put the same secret in `order-service/.env.docker` as `CREDIT_SERVICE_SECRET`.
3. Start everything:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file user-service/.env --profile order --profile credit up --build -d
   ```

Compose starts `credit-service` (port `127.0.0.1:8003`) and `credit-consumer`, and gives
Order the internal origin `http://credit-service:8003`. The web client reaches
`/v1/wallets...` and `/v1/admin/wallets...` through nginx; `/v1/internal/*` is not routed
to Credit. Start the consumer before users register: RabbitMQ drops events published
while no Credit queue is bound. Users who registered earlier still receive their wallet
and allocation on first use (wallet view, first errand, or first payout).

## D3 demo

1. Register two users (requester and courier). Each `GET /v1/wallets/me` (the Credits
   page) shows `available 20, reserved 0, total 20`.
2. The requester creates an errand with reward 5: `15 / 5 / 20`, history shows
   *Reserved for errand*.
3. The courier accepts, picks up and delivers; the requester completes. Requester
   `15 / 0 / 15`; courier `25 / 0 / 25`, history shows *Errand reward +5*.
4. The requester creates and cancels another errand: the reserve and its release both
   appear in history and the balance returns.
5. Redelivery: in the RabbitMQ UI (`http://localhost:15672`) publish the completion
   payload again to `foc.events` with routing key and `type` `order.completed.v1`.
   Balances do not change; the consumer logs `outcome=DUPLICATE`.
6. Consumer outage: `docker compose stop credit-consumer`, cancel an errand, then
   `docker compose start credit-consumer`. The release is applied after restart.
7. Durability: `docker compose restart credit-service credit-consumer`; balances are
   unchanged.

## Observability

- Consumer log lines: `event processed event_id=… type=… entity_id=… outcome=…
  attempt=… duration_ms=…`, `event scheduled for retry …` and `event dead-lettered …`
  (`docker compose logs -f credit-consumer`). Logs never contain tokens or secrets.
- Every HTTP response carries `X-Correlation-ID` (echoed from the request when safe).
- Queue depth: RabbitMQ UI → Queues → `credit-service.events`, `.retry`, `.dlq`.
- Processing records (Credit Studio `http://localhost:16523` or `psql`):

  ```sql
  SELECT event_type, outcome, count(*) FROM credit_service.processed_events GROUP BY 1, 2;
  SELECT * FROM credit_service.event_failures ORDER BY failed_at DESC LIMIT 20;
  ```

- Invariant check (credits held always equal credits allocated):

  ```sql
  SELECT (SELECT sum(available + reserved) FROM credit_service.wallets) AS held,
         (SELECT sum(amount) FROM credit_service.credit_transactions
           WHERE type = 'ALLOCATION') AS allocated;
  ```
